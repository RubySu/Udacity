## Introduction
Germany as a highly developed country with a very high standard of living, it offers social security and a universal health care system, environmental protections, and a tuition-free university education.
You may have heard statements like "you can find a most stable job with high salary in Germany" or "woman can get same salary as man in Germany."
Now, I would like to interpret these questions by analyzing data from Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey. What does the data answer?
Stack overflowÂ logoThe survey data covers 64,000 reviews from 213 countries and territories. The survey aims to understand multiple aspects of jobs related to software development and data analytics. There were more than 150 questions as a part of the survey, including:
" Which of the following best describes you?"
" Which of the following best describes your current employment status?"
" Which of the following best describes the highest level of formal education that you've completed?"
